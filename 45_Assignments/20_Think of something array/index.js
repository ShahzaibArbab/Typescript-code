// ## 20_Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var languages = ["Sindhi", "Urdu", "Pashto", "English"];
console.log("languages i like to speak \n", languages);
languages.forEach(function (list) {
    console.log("language i like to speak ", list);
});
